Yalo
====

Target: yalo is a Lisp OS running on bare metal x86-64 hardware. The system
programming language is **Ink**, a new Lisp dialect which combines the
elegance of Scheme and powerfulness of Common Lisp. The project webpage
is: <https://github.com/whily/yalo>

Status: the project is only at very very initial stage, with an
assembler written in Common Lisp, and a 16 bit bootloader.
